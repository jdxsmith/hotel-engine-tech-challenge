# GitHub Repository Search Engine

## Project Overview
- React Code Challenge for Hotel Engine
- The goal was to build a React app that allows users to search the GitHub repositories API and let them sort repositories by stars/best match, and filter by language.  The repositories should display relevant information when selected.

## Set Up

* *Click* the **Fork** button on the top right-hand corner of this page
* Clone the repository down and cd into the repo on your local machine by running:
  * `git clone git@github.com:jdxsmith/hotel-engine-tech-challenge.git`
  * `cd hotel-engine-tech-challenge`
* Install the library dependencies by running:
  * `npm install`
* To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal.
* Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see the site.
* Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
